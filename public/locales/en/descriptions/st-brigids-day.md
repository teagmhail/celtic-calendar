When Ireland became Christian, many of Brigid’s attributes were transferred to St. Brigid of Kildare, and her feast day came to share the same date. St. Brigid’s Day preserved much of the earlier tradition while blending it with Christian devotion.

Customs included weaving **Brigid’s Crosses** from rushes and hanging them in homes for protection, leaving out a cloth or ribbon called the **Bratóg Bríde** to receive St. Brigid’s blessing overnight, and crafting figures or dolls known as **Brídeóg** that were carried from house to house. People also lit candles and fires to honor Brigid’s association with light and the returning sun.

Today, Imbolc and St. Brigid’s Day are still celebrated together as a time of hope, renewal, and the quiet beginning of spring.
